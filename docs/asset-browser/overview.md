# Overview

In addition to the main add-on, the Procedural Interiors pack includes a collection of materials, models, and procedural assets that can be accessed directly through Blender’s Asset Browser. These assets allow you to quickly populate your interiors with ready-to-use furniture, and parametric elements.
