# Procedural Interiors

![Background Image](/assets/images/background.png)

The Procedural Interiors add-on makes it easy to generate apartment or house interiors, including architectural elements like interior walls, columns, windows, doors, and staircases. You can start from scratch or use the Reference feature to import a floor plan and trace your building based on that reference.

The add-on leverages the procedural power of Geometry Nodes, allowing users to adjust the height of each floor, the dimensions of windows and doors, and many other parameters.

With Procedural Interiors, you can divide the overall space into separate rooms or areas and use preset functionality to easily furnish each one.

Finally, you can also prepare your model for export outside of Blender, in case you need to use it in another software.
