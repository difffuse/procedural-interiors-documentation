# Overlays

![Overlays Tab](/assets/images/overlay_tab.png)

The top 7 buttons in this tab toggle specific overlays from the add-on:
Show/hide all add-on overlays
Measurements
Angles
Empty Areas (spaces not yet assigned to a room type)
Labels (Surfaces & Room Designations)
Highlight the selected floor
Highlight subspaces (Rooms)


The last two parameters (8 and 9) let you adjust the overlay opacity and the measurement offset, respectively.
To quickly disable overlays you can use the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+A
