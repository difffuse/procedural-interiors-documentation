# Openings & Circulation

Design doors, windows, and circulation systems for optimal traffic flow and accessibility.

## Overview

Openings and circulation systems control movement, light, and air flow through interior spaces while ensuring safety, accessibility, and code compliance.

## Door Systems

### Door Types

- **Revolving Doors**: High-traffic entrance doors with weather sealing

### Door Specifications
- **Width**: Standard residential (32", 36") and commercial (36", 42") widths
- **Height**: Standard 80" residential, 84" commercial heights
- **Swing Direction**: Left-hand, right-hand, inswing, outswing
- **Fire Rating**: 20-minute, 45-minute, 90-minute fire doors
- **Hardware**: Handles, locks, hinges, and accessibility features

## Window Systems

### Window Types
- **Double-Hung**: Traditional sash windows with upper and lower panels
- **Casement**: Side-hinged windows that swing outward
- **Sliding**: Horizontal sliding window panels
- **Fixed**: Non-operable windows for views and light
- **Awning**: Top-hinged windows that open outward from bottom

### Window Performance
- **Energy Efficiency**: U-factor, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)
- **Air Infiltration**: Air leakage rates and weather sealing
- **Sound Transmission**: Acoustic performance ratings
- **Security**: Impact resistance and locking mechanisms
- **Maintenance**: Cleaning access and hardware durability

## Circulation Planning

### Traffic Flow Analysis
- **Primary Circulation**: Main movement corridors and pathways
- **Secondary Circulation**: Access to specific rooms and areas
- **Emergency Egress**: Exit routes and emergency access
- **Service Circulation**: Delivery, maintenance, and utility access

### Circulation Principles
- **Clear Width**: Minimum corridor and doorway widths
- **Turning Radius**: Space for wheelchair and mobility device turning
- **Sight Lines**: Visual connections and wayfinding
- **Traffic Separation**: Separate public and private circulation

## Accessibility Features

### ADA Compliance
- **Door Width**: Minimum 32" clear width for accessibility
- **Threshold Height**: Maximum 1/2" height difference
- **Operating Force**: Maximum force required to open doors
- **Maneuvering Space**: Clear floor space at doors and windows

### Universal Design
- **Lever Handles**: Easy-to-operate door and window hardware
- **Automatic Operators**: Power-assisted door opening systems
- **Visual Indicators**: Glass marking and contrast requirements
- **Tactile Elements**: Textured surfaces for visually impaired users

## Code Requirements

### Egress Requirements
- **Exit Width**: Minimum width based on occupant load
- **Travel Distance**: Maximum distance to exits
- **Exit Discharge**: Safe dispersal area outside building
- **Emergency Lighting**: Illumination for emergency egress

### Fire Safety
- **Fire Doors**: Self-closing doors in fire-rated assemblies
- **Smoke Barriers**: Doors that prevent smoke spread
- **Exit Signs**: Illuminated exit identification
- **Panic Hardware**: Quick-release exit devices

## Opening Creation Tools

### Automatic Placement
- **Room Analysis**: Optimal door and window placement based on function
- **Code Compliance**: Automatic compliance with egress requirements
- **Traffic Flow**: Placement that supports efficient circulation
- **Natural Light**: Window placement for optimal daylighting

### Manual Placement
- **Wall Selection**: Choose wall location for opening
- **Size Definition**: Set width and height dimensions
- **Type Selection**: Choose door or window type and style
- **Hardware Specification**: Select handles, locks, and operators

## Circulation Systems

### Horizontal Circulation
- **Corridors**: Primary and secondary circulation corridors
- **Lobbies**: Entrance and distribution spaces
- **Galleries**: Extended circulation with display or seating
- **Bridges**: Connections between separate building areas

### Vertical Circulation
- **Stairs**: Code-compliant stairway design and placement
- **Ramps**: Accessible sloped circulation for level changes
- **Elevators**: Vertical transportation for accessibility
- **Escalators**: Moving stairs for high-traffic applications

## Advanced Opening Features

### Smart Door Systems
- **Access Control**: Electronic locks and card readers
- **Automatic Operation**: Motion sensors and push-button activation
- **Integration**: Connection with security and building systems
- **Monitoring**: Door position and usage tracking

### High-Performance Windows
- **Dynamic Glazing**: Electrochromic and thermochromic glass
- **Integrated Shading**: Built-in blinds and shading systems
- **Ventilation Control**: Automated opening for natural ventilation
- **Energy Monitoring**: Real-time energy performance tracking

## Opening Coordination

### Structural Integration
- **Header Design**: Structural support over openings
- **Rough Opening**: Proper sizing for door and window installation
- **Flashing Details**: Weather protection and moisture management
- **Thermal Bridging**: Insulation continuity around openings

### MEP Coordination
- **Electrical**: Switches, outlets, and lighting near openings
- **Security**: Alarm contacts and access control wiring
- **HVAC**: Air flow considerations around doors and windows
- **Technology**: Data and communication system integration

## Circulation Analysis Tools

### Flow Simulation
- **Pedestrian Modeling**: Simulate people movement through spaces
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find circulation constraints
- **Capacity Analysis**: Determine maximum occupancy levels
- **Emergency Evacuation**: Model emergency egress scenarios

### Performance Metrics
- **Travel Time**: Average time to reach destinations
- **Congestion Levels**: Peak usage and crowding analysis
- **Accessibility Score**: Universal design compliance rating
- **Efficiency Rating**: Circulation system effectiveness measure

## Best Practices

### Door Placement
1. **Corner Clearance**: Avoid doors too close to corners
2. **Swing Direction**: Consider furniture placement and traffic flow
3. **Privacy**: Balance access with privacy requirements
4. **Emergency Access**: Ensure clear egress paths

### Window Design
1. **View Orientation**: Optimize views and minimize glare
2. **Natural Light**: Balance daylight with heat gain
3. **Ventilation**: Cross-ventilation for natural cooling
4. **Privacy**: Consider sight lines and screening needs

### Circulation Design
1. **Intuitive Layout**: Clear and logical circulation patterns
2. **Flexibility**: Accommodate different user needs and abilities
3. **Efficiency**: Minimize unnecessary travel distances
4. **Safety**: Ensure safe and secure movement throughout space

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Door Conflicts**: Doors that interfere with each other or furniture
- **Code Violations**: Non-compliant egress width or travel distance
- **Accessibility Problems**: Insufficient maneuvering space or operating force
- **Traffic Bottlenecks**: Inadequate circulation width or poor layout

### Performance Problems
