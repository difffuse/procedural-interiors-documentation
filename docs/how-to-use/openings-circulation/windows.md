## Overview

You can choose between hinged windows or sliding windows by clicking the window icon (1).

## Window Settings

Expand Draw Settings to view the available parameters (2). For windows, you can choose between two placement methods:

### Placement Methods

1. **Click and Drag** - Draw the window directly on the wall by defining a rectangle
   - The Align Top and Align Bottom checkboxes, along with the Window Top and Window Bottom parameters, allow you to set specific positions for the top and bottom edges
   - This helps keep all your windows consistent in size

2. **Place Window** - Set the width in advance, then simply click on a wall to place a window with those dimensions

## Controls

Just like with the elements in the Structure section, you can use the Draw and Reposition buttons to place or move the windows (3 and 4).
