# Doors

![Doors Tab](/assets/images/draw_door.png)

## Overview

Doors work the same way, although in this case, you must set both the width and height before placing them.

Among the available doors, interior doors are procedural, meaning they adapt to the height and width you set. However, exterior doors have fixed dimensions that cannot be changed, and you also won't be able to set the door opening angle for them.
