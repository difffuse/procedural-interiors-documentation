# Stairs

## Overview

Staircases work in the same way. In this case, when you click the Draw button, the view will automatically switch to top view, and you can draw staircases with up to three sections.
IMPORTANT:
 A current limitation is that, for the staircase to be placed correctly, you must draw the points in a clockwise direction.
