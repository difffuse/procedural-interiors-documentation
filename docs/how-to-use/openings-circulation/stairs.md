# Stairs

## Overview

Staircases follow a similar workflow to other elements in the add-on.

## Creating Stairs

When you click the Draw button:
1. The view will automatically switch to top view
2. You can draw staircases with up to three sections

> **IMPORTANT:**
> A current limitation is that, for the staircase to be placed correctly, you must draw the points in a **clockwise direction**.
