# Apply Model

![Apply Model Button](/assets/images/applymodelbutton.png)

When you’re done drawing and parametrizing your model, you can use the Apply Button to deconstruct the procedural object into separate objects, organized by floor level in a collection hierarchy. This will lose the parametric control but will allow you to continue the work with the regular Blender workflow. The procedural object will remain hidden in the scene in case you want to revisit it.
