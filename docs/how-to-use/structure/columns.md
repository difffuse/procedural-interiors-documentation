You can add columns to your structure with the following options:

- Set their diameter, rotation, and distribution type in the settings
- Click Draw Columns to start placing them in your scene

## Adjusting Columns


Once you're done placing columns:
1. Press Enter to confirm
2. A popup will appear with the column parameters (if you have that option enabled in the settings)
3. You can adjust them there if needed—or access them anytime later from the Parametrize tab
