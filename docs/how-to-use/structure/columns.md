# Columns

## Adding Columns

You can add columns to your structure with the following options:
- Choose between circular or square columns
- Set their diameter, rotation, and distribution type in the settings
- Click Draw Columns to start placing them in your scene

## Adjusting Columns

Once you're done placing columns:
1. Press Enter to confirm
2. A popup will appear with the column parameters (if you have that option enabled in the settings)
3. You can adjust them there if neededâ€”or access them anytime later from the Parametrize tab

> **Tip:** You can also use the Reposition Columns button to move the columns if needed.
