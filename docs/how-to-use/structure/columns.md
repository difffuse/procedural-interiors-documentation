# Columns

You can add columns to your structure, choose between circular or square columns, set their diameter, rotation, and distribution type in the settings. Then click Draw Columns to start placing them in your scene.

Once you're done, press Enter, and a popup will appear with the column parameters (if you have that option enabled in the settings). You can adjust them there if neededâ€”or access them anytime later from the Parametrize tab.

You can also use the Reposition Columns button to move the columns if needed.
