## Best Practices

### Reference Selection
1. **Know Your Jurisdiction**: Use appropriate local codes and standards
2. **Consider Context**: Match standards to project type and use
3. **Stay Current**: Regularly update reference libraries
4. **Document Choices**: Record which standards were applied and why

### Validation Strategy
1. **Early and Often**: Check compliance throughout design process
2. **Prioritize Critical Items**: Focus on safety and accessibility first
3. **Balance Compliance**: Consider creative solutions within standards
4. **Professional Review**: Have qualified professionals verify compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Reference Data Issues
